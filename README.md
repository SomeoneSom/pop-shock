# TO BUILD

You will need:

- Everything you need to build Kade Engine

- extension-webm (use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k67RvU6qI_Q) as reference to install it)

- CMake version 3.20 or above (NOT 3.2.0)

After you have those, just run build.bat and it will do all the work for you.

# READ THIS BEFORE PLAYING:

As you might have noticed, your desktop wallpaper has changed, the icons are gone, and the taskbar is gone.
Don't worry, these are to hide messy desktops for people who are recording or streaming this mod.
It will automatically revert when the game closes.
There is also a flat version availble if you cant run this version.

## IF THE GAME CRASHES AND DOESN'T RESTORE EVERYTHING:

Go to the directory Pop Shock.exe is in (the Windows key will still work) and run restoreInCaseOfCrash.exe.
Do not run the game again when it crashes as it will overwrite the path to your original desktop wallpaper.
## IF YOU ARE RECORDING OR STERAMING THIS:

Please use display capture.

## IF YOU FULLSCREEN THIS:

It will break and you'll have to rerun the mod most likely.\n"

Enjoy the mod and make sure to exit with Alt+F4!
